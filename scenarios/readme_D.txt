The Type of Water (Where can we go to fish?)
Type of variable: Categorical

Are you a brave open sea fisher or a more reserved and mainland fisher? That is the first
question you must ask yourself. The possibilities for places to fish are "ocean", "sea", "lake",
"river" and "pond".


The Fisher (Who can fish where?)
Type of variable: Categorical

There exist five different fishing companies. Each of these companies can only fish in one
certain water-type to not compete with another fishing company. Also each fishing company
has to decide on one single fishing-method. The fishing-method will later define the chances
of actually catching fish. The fishers do not know what type of fish will be available for them
before they are not on the open water. That is why they decide on a method before setting
sails in hope to be successful.


The Fish (What type of fish swims where?)
Type of variable: Categorical 

It’s all about the fish! Based on where the fisher fishes and how, the fisher will be able to
catch different types of fish. The available options are whale", "tuna", "carp", "shark" and
"bass". 


The Catch (I’ll be home soon honey. Just going for a quick fish!)
Type of variable: Boolean [0/1] 

Now comes the moment of truth! The fisher is on the open water and tries to catch the fish.
He already decided for a certain method in hope to catch the fish of his desire. If the method
he had initially chosen is congruent with the method needed to catch the fish, the fisher will
have 100% chance of catching the fish. If it is the wrong method, he will only have a 50%
chance.


The Quality (How good was the fishing?)
Type of variable: Ordered categorical 

So you were able to reel in the bounty, now you have to assess its value! You can quantify
the quality of the fish based on this scale. 


The Length (Measuring the Catch!)
Type of variable: Real-valued 

The next step for assessing the value of the fish is taking its measurements. Take a
(considerably big) ruler and measure the length of your catch. 


The Weight (Heavy, heavy!)
Type of variable: Real-valued 

Now, weight the fish! The weight of the fish defines the price and therewith the profit.


The Material (Don’t forget the gas)
Type of variable: Real-valued 

Material cost per 100 g of fish.


The Transportation (Don’t forget the gas)
Type of variable: Real-valued

Transportation cost per 100g of fish.


The Freshness (And the problem of the distribution cold chain)
Type of variable: Boolean [0/1]

Spent a week at sea? Maybe some of those early catches won’t sell at that high of a price.
The freshness will influence the decision of the retailers on what to buy of course! You can
either consider fish as fresh or not fresh.


The profit: (I spent all of my bait! Time to make the money)
Type of variable: Real-valued response variable (dependent)

Now that you have done your fishing, you want some monetary return for it....
